# Encrypter
Shell Script Encrypter V3 By Dotycat

## I created this tool specifically for Debian, and encrypted files generated by this tool can only run on Debian. Thank you.

## INSTALLATION
<pre><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aNzTikTok/Encrypter/main/install-enc.sh && chmod +x /root/install-enc.sh && ./install-enc.sh</code></pre>

## HOW TO USE
- This is a basic shell encrypter for encrypting multiple shell files.
- First, run the installation check at the installation station.
- Then, upload the shell file that you want to encrypt to /root/enc.
- Once the upload is complete, simply run the encrypter by typing enc. All shell files inside /root/enc will be encrypted, and the encrypted files will be saved in /root/enc/output, while the original files will be saved in the /root/enc folder.
